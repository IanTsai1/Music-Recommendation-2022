# Music-Recommendation
KKLAB 2022 Internship


DataCleaning.py cleans the files, so it's able to run in the ML algorithm. 
FeatureEng1.py is the original version of my file. However, the methods I used to create new features were inefficent so I created FeatureEng2.py
FeatureEng2.py creates new features to increase the accuracy of my algorithm. 
RandomForest.py is the ML algorithm I used for my recommendation system.

I created a lot of test/train files since my computer can't handle cleaning the data and running the ML algorithm at the same time. Thus, I created a new
copy of the datset everytime I made major data cleaning or feature engineering changes.
